          <div class="item">
            <p> I discovered my passion for coding while distance teaching my daughter this spring.
              I found teaching her and learning simple coding prcesses was something I really enjoyed. I have submerged
              myself in
              the field of Software Engineering,
              becoming an effiect web developer. I have worked on serveral projects and applications that are listed in
              my
              portfolio.</p>
            <p> When I am not coding, I run an independent record label called <a
                href="http://www.learningcurverecords.com">Learning Curve Records</a>. Working
              with artists around the world, I have coordinated press camagins, tours and networking for clients.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I love to spend time with my daughter Iris. Gardening in our yard, building projects,
              having fun are top activites for the two of us. I also enjoy cooking and listening to vinyl records.</p>
