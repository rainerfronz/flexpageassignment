            <h2>Hello, I am RAiner!</h2>
            <p>intro</p>
            <p> I am currently a student in the Software Engineering Program at Thinkful.
              I am well versed in front-end and back-end web development. I create functional easy to use web
              experiences
              to attract and hold a web surfers attention.
            </p>
            <p>Working under pressure is what I do, I come from a backgound in the service and music industries.
              Networking
              teamwork and self-motavation are several traits I often use to describe myself. I am eager to learn from
              and
              work with others to achieve whatever goal we have set out to a reach. </p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="group">
          <div class="item-double">
            <p> I discovered my passion for coding while distance teaching my daughter this spring.
              I found teaching her and learning simple coding prcesses was something I really enjoyed. I have submerged
              myself in
              the field of Software Engineering,
              becoming an effiect web developer. I have worked on serveral projects and applications that are listed in
              my
              portfolio.</p>
            <p> When I am not coding, I run an independent record label called <a href="http://www.learningcurverecords.com">Learning Curve Records</a>. Working 
with artists around the world, I have coordinated press camagins, tours and networking for clients.
</p> 
<p>In my spare time, I love to spend time with my daughter Iris. Gardening in our yard, building projects,
    having fun are top activites for the two of us. I also enjoy cooking and listening to vinyl records.</p>
