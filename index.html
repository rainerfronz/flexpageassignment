      <p>intro</p>
      <p>Hello, I am Rainer Fronz. I am currently a student in teh Software Engineering Program at Thinkful.
          I am well versed in front-end and back-end web development. I create functional, easy to use web experiences
          to attract and hold a web surfers attention. 
          </p><p>Working under pressure is what I do, I come from a backgound in the service and music industry. Networking
              teamwork and self-motavation are several traits I often use to describe myself. I am eager to learn from and 
              work with others to achieve whatever goal we have set out to a reach. </p>
       <hr> <p><h3>About Me</h3> I discovered my passion for coding while distance teaching my daughter this spring. 
    I found teaching her and learning simple coding prcesses was something I really enjoyed. I have submerged myself in the field, 
becoming an effiect web developer. I have worked on serveral projects and applications that are listed in my portfolio.</p>
<p> When I am not coding, I run an independent record label called <a href="http://www.learningcurverecords.com
"">Learning Curve Records</a>. Working 
with artists around the world, I have coordinated press camagins, tours and networking for clients around the world.</p>
</p> <p>In my spare time, I love to spend time with my daughter. Gardening in our yard, building projects,
    having fun are top activites for the two of us. I also enjoy cooking and listening to vinyl records.</p>
